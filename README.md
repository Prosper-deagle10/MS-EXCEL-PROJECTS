INTERACTIVE DASHBOARDS AND INSIGHTFUL EXCEL PROJECTS


üìä Project Title: Sales Analysis & Insights

üí° Project Aim:
The aim of this project was to carry out a descriptive analysis on the sales data for an outlet store which started operation 2011 and generated some insights on their performance.
PROJECT PROCESS:
About the Dataset:
I analyzed a comprehensive sales dataset with columns including date, customer age, age group, gender, country, state, product category, sub-category, products, order-quantity, unit cost and price, total cost and revenue, and profit.

Data Cleaning:
I cleaned the data by doing the following;
‚Ä¢	Duplicates
‚Ä¢	Missing Values
‚Ä¢	Missing rows/columns
‚Ä¢	Standardization 
Among the questions I provided answers to in the dashboard, I will discuss two major questions, the findings and recommendations.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Question 1: What sub-categories of product contribute to the total revenue of the Outlet store.

The Outlet Stores has 17 sub-categories of products. After summing the total revenue based on each sub-category and sorting based on top 5. I discovered that Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes, Touring Bikes, Helmets and Tires and Tubes sub-categories contributed the largest to the total revenue of Outlet Stores.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Question 2: Sequel to Question 1, what products are ordered most in the outlet store.

The Outlet Store has 130 products which I counted using Count A function. After counting the total quantities order for each product and sorting based on top 5. I discovered that Water Bottle ‚Äì 30 oz, Patch Kit/8 Patches, Mountain Tire Tube, AWC Logo Cap and Sport-100 Helmet, Red are the top 5 most ordered products in the Outlet stores.

Observation for Question 1 and 2: I discovered that Water Bottle ‚Äì 30 oz which falls under Bottle and Cage Sub-category does not fall under the top 5 sub-categories contributing to Outlet stores total revenue. The reason being that Bottle and Cage Sub-category does not have as many products as sub-categories of Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes, Touring Bikes, Helmets and Tires and Tubes which are the top 5 contributors to Outlet store total revenue. However, product of Patch Kit/8 Patches, Mountain Tire Tube and Sport-100 Helmet, Red fall under the top-5 subcategories of Helmets and Tires and Tubes.
 
Recommendation: The Outlet stores should take note of Water Bottle ‚Äì 30 oz as a product that drives sales. Also, given that Patch Kit/8 Patches, Mountain Tire Tube and Sport-100 Helmet, Red falls under the most ordered products and they are under the top 5 sub-categories contributing to the revenue of Outlet stores, their inventory should increase.
